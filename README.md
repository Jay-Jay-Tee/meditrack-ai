## Key Features Explained

### 1. Voice-to-Medical-Note

**How it works:**
- Uses browser's **Web Speech API** (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Real-time transcription as you speak
- No backend processing needed - runs entirely in browser
- Automatically detects pauses and punctuation
- Perfect for hands-free data entry during patient consultations

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Safari: Partial support
- Firefox: Not supported yet

**Usage Tips:**
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Browser will ask for microphone permission (allow it)
- Red pulsing button indicates active recording
- Click again to stop recording

### 2. Multi-Hospital Patient IDs

**Problem Solved:**
Traditional systems use hospital-specific IDs, making it impossible to track patients across facilities.

**Our Solution:**
- Every user gets a **globally unique ID** (format: `MED-XXXXXXXX`)
- Hospital name stored with each record
- Patients can visit multiple hospitals using same ID
- Easy coordination of care between facilities

**Example Workflow:**
```
Patient registers: MED-A1B2C3D4 at "City Hospital"
Visits emergency room at "County Hospital" → Uses same ID
Primary care at "Memorial Clinic" → Same ID again
All records unified in one timeline!
```

### 3. Semantic Timeline Analysis

**What is Semantic Search?**
Instead of keyword matching, we use AI embeddings to understand *meaning*.

**Example:**
```
Traditional Search: "heart attack" only finds exact phrase
Semantic Search: Also finds "myocardial infarction", 
                  "cardiac arrest", "MI", etc.
```

### 4. AI-Powered Insights

**What the AI Does:**
- Analyzes complete medical timeline
- Identifies patterns and trends
- Describes frequency of visits
- Notes temporal gaps or clusters
- Provides neutral, factual summary

**What the AI Does NOT Do:**
- Diagnose conditions
- Suggest treatments
- Make medical recommendations
- Replace healthcare professionals

**Powered by Groq:**
- Llama 3.3 70B model
- Fastest AI inference available (~500 tokens/second)
- Free tier: 14,400 requests/day
- No GPU required on your machine

### 5. Professional PDF Export

**What's Included:**
- Hospital letterhead-style header
- Patient ID and generation timestamp
- Complete timeline table with:
  - Dates formatted professionally
  - Event types color-coded
  - Full content of each event
- Print-optimized layout
- HIPAA-style formatting

**Perfect For:**
- Specialist referrals
- Insurance claims
- Medical record requests
- Patient handouts
- Legal documentation

### 6. Shareable Patient Links

**How It Works:**
- Every patient gets unique URL: `/patient/MED-XXXXXXXX`
- Read-only view - cannot edit or add records
- No login required to view
- Perfect for sharing with:
  - Doctors
  - Specialists
  - Family members
  - Insurance companies

**Security:**
- URL is the only "password" (security through obscurity)
- No sensitive data visible without the link
- Can be revoked by changing Patient ID (future feature)

---

## Security Features

### Password Security
- **bcrypt hashing** with automatic salt generation
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Industry-standard algorithm (used by GitHub, Google, etc.)

### Session Management
- **Flask-Login** for secure sessions
- HTTPOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection enabled
- Automatic session expiration

### Data Protection
- All API calls require authentication
- Patient data isolated by Patient ID
- No SQL injection risk (using NoSQL vector database)
- Input sanitization on all fields

### HTTPS Ready
Works seamlessly with production WSGI servers (Gunicorn + nginx) for HTTPS encryption.

## Scope & Medical Disclaimer

Medical Timeline AI is an **information retrieval and summarization system**, not a diagnostic or decision-making tool.  
All AI-generated outputs are derived strictly from stored patient events and are intended to **assist human understanding**, not replace professional medical judgment.

This system:
- Does **not** diagnose conditions
- Does **not** recommend treatments
- Does **not** perform causal or clinical inference

Clinicians and users must independently verify all information.

---

## Current Limitations

The following features are **intentionally out of scope** for the current implementation and represent future extensions:

- Explicit causal inference between events (e.g., medication → lab outcome)
- Formal citation tagging for individual AI-generated statements
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging
- Image/audio semantic embeddings (current support is text and documents)
- Regulatory compliance enforcement (HIPAA/GDPR layers)

These limitations do **not** affect core timeline storage, semantic search, or reporting functionality.
