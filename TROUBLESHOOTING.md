## 📄 Document Upload/Download Issues

### Issue: Document preview not showing

**Problem:** Image or PDF preview doesn't display after selecting file.

**Solution:**

1. **Check file type:**
   ```
   ✅ Supported: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .pdf
   ❌ Not supported: .docx, .txt, .zip, .heic
   ```

2. **Check file size:**
   ```
   Maximum: 10MB per file
   If larger: Compress image or split PDF
   ```

3. **For images - verify it's actually an image:**
   ```javascript
   // Check in browser console (F12):
   const input = document.getElementById('fileInput');
   console.log(input.files[0].type);
   // Should show: "image/jpeg" or "image/png"
   ```

4. **Hard refresh the page:**
   ```
   Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

### Issue: Document upload fails

**Problem:** Error when trying to upload document.

**Solution:**

1. **Check uploads folder exists:**
   ```bash
   # Server should create it automatically, but verify:
   ls -la uploads/
   # If missing:
   mkdir uploads
   chmod 755 uploads
   ```

2. **Check disk space:**
   ```bash
   df -h
   # Make sure you have free space
   ```

3. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for errors in terminal where you ran:
   python app.py
   
   # Common errors:
   [ERROR] Document upload error: Permission denied
   [ERROR] Document upload error: No space left on device
   ```

4. **Verify file permissions:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   chmod 755 uploads/
   
   # On Windows: Right-click folder → Properties → Security
   ```

### Issue: Download button not appearing

**Problem:** Uploaded document but can't see download button in timeline.

**Solution:**

1. **Verify upload completed:**
   - Check for success message after upload
   - Look in server logs for "✅ Document stored"
   
2. **Check the uploads folder:**
   ```bash
   ls -la uploads/
   # Should see files with UUID names like:
   # a1b2c3d4-5e6f-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.pdf
   ```

3. **Re-analyze timeline:**
   - Click "Analyze Timeline" button again
   - Download buttons should appear for documents

4. **Check browser console:**
   ```javascript
   // Press F12 → Console tab
   // Look for JavaScript errors
   ```

---

### Issue: Download fails or file corrupted

**Problem:** Download button works but file won't open.

**Solution:**

1. **Check file exists on server:**
   ```bash
   ls -la uploads/
   # Verify the file is there and has size > 0
   ```

2. **Check file integrity:**
   ```bash
   # On server:
   file uploads/filename.pdf
   # Should show: "PDF document" or "JPEG image"
   ```

3. **Try different browser:**
   - Chrome/Edge usually work best
   - Firefox/Safari may have different download behavior

4. **Check download folder:**
   - File might be in different location
   - Check browser's download settings

---

### Issue: Uploaded document not showing in shared timeline

**Problem:** Document appears in your timeline but not when sharing link.

**Solution:**

1. **Verify file was uploaded after creating the event:**
   - The file must be successfully uploaded
   - Check for green success message

2. **Hard refresh the shared page:**
   ```
   Open shared link
   Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
   ```

3. **Check if uploads folder is accessible:**
   ```python
   # In app.py, verify:
   @app.route("/download-document/<filename>")
   # This endpoint must be working
   ```

4. **Test direct download URL:**
   ```
   Open: http://localhost:5000/download-document/your-file-uuid.pdf
   Should download the file
   ```

## 🎨 UI/UX Issues

### Issue: Text boxes are hard to read (black text on dark background)

**✅ FIXED!** The new version uses CSS variables for proper theming:
- Light mode: White input backgrounds with dark text
- Dark mode: Dark gray input backgrounds with light text
- All inputs now have proper contrast and borders
- Toggle dark mode with the moon/sun button

**How to verify the fix:**
1. Reload the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check input fields - should have clear borders
3. Try dark mode toggle - text should always be readable

---

### Issue: Voice input button not responding

**Problem:** Browser doesn't support Web Speech API or microphone blocked.

**Solution:**

1. **Use Chrome or Edge** (Firefox doesn't support it yet)
   ```
   ✅ Chrome: Full support
   ✅ Edge: Full support
   ⚠️ Safari: Partial support
   ❌ Firefox: Not supported
   ```

2. **Allow microphone permissions:**
   - Chrome: Click lock icon in address bar → Microphone → Allow
   - Edge: Same as Chrome
   - Safari: Settings → Websites → Microphone → Allow

3. **Test microphone:**
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
     .then(stream => console.log('Mic works!'))
     .catch(err => console.error('Mic error:', err))
   ```

4. **Check HTTPS requirement:**
   - Voice input requires HTTPS in production
   - Works on localhost for development
   - Use ngrok for testing: `ngrok http 5000`

**Still not working?**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Try different browser
- Restart browser

---

### Issue: Document upload preview not showing

**Problem:** File type not supported or file too large.

**Solution:**

   ```
   ✅ Supported: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .pdf
   ❌ Not supported: .docx, .txt, .zip
   ```

2. **Check file size:**
   ```
   Maximum: 10MB per file
   Recommended: Under 5MB
   ```

3. **Compress large images:**
   ```bash
   # Use online tools:
   - TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com)
   - Squoosh (https://squoosh.app)
   ```

4. **Try drag-and-drop:**
   - Sometimes file input button fails
   - Drag file directly to drop zone
   - Should see border turn blue

## 🔐 Authentication Issues

### Issue: "Email already registered" but I don't have an account

**Problem:** You tried to register before, or someone else used that email.

**Solution:**

1. **Try logging in instead:**
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Use the email and password you remember
   
2. **Use different email:**
   - Gmail allows aliases: `youremail+hospital@gmail.com`
   - Each alias is treated as unique

3. **Clear browser data:**
   ```
   Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   Select: Cookies and site data
   ```

---

### Issue: "Invalid credentials" when logging in

**Problem:** Email or password incorrect, or account doesn't exist.

**Solution:**

1. **Check email spelling:**
   - No spaces before/after
   - Correct domain (.com vs .org)
   
2. **Try creating new account:**
   - Click "Create one"
   - Use same email (will tell you if it exists)

3. **Password requirements:**
   - Current system: No specific requirements
   - Tip: Use strong password anyway!

---

### Issue: Not staying logged in / Session expires

**Problem:** Cookies not saving or session timeout.

**Solution:**

1. **Enable cookies:**
   ```
   Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Cookies → Allow all
   Edge: Same as Chrome
   ```

2. **Check third-party cookies:**
   - Some ad blockers block Flask sessions
   - Whitelist localhost:5000

3. **Session expires after:**
   - Default: Browser close
   - Future update: Remember me checkbox

---

## 🚀 Server Issues

### Issue: "Connection refused" or "Cannot connect to server"

**Problem:** Flask server not running or wrong port.

**Solution:**

1. **Check if server is running:**
   ```bash
   # Look for this output:
   * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

2. **Restart server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop: Ctrl+C
   # Start: python app.py
   ```

3. **Check port availability:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   lsof -i :5000
   
   # On Windows:
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   ```

4. **Use different port:**
   ```bash
   # In app.py, change last line to:
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
   ```

pip install fastembed
pip install groq
pip install flask flask-cors flask-login
```

---

### Issue: "Failed to initialize application" on startup

**Problem:** Missing environment variables or invalid credentials.

**Solution:**

1. **Check .env file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .env  # Should show the file
   ```

2. **Verify .env contents:**
   ```bash
   cat .env
   # Should show all three keys:
   # QDRANT_URL=...
   # QDRANT_API_KEY=...
   # GROQ_API_KEY=...
   # SECRET_KEY=...
   ```

3. **Test Qdrant connection:**
   ```python
